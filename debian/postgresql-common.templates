Template: postgresql-common/obsolete-major
Type: error
_Description: Obsolete major version ${old}
 The PostgreSQL version ${old} is obsolete, but the server
 or client packages are still installed. Please install the latest packages
 (postgresql-${latest} and postgresql-client-${latest}) and upgrade the
 existing ${oldversion} clusters with pg_upgradecluster (see manpage).
 .
 Please be aware that the installation of postgresql-${latest} will
 automatically create a default cluster ${latest}/main. If you want to upgrade
 the ${old}/main cluster, you need to remove the already existing ${latest}
 cluster (pg_dropcluster --stop ${latest} main, see manpage for
 details).
 .
 The old server and client packages are no longer supported. After the
 existing clusters are upgraded, the postgresql-${old} and
 postgresql-client-${old} packages should be removed.
 .
 Please see /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz for details.
